This project uses NextJS, React, Tailwind CSS, with Firebase for authentication and Supabase for data storage. For product filtering, implement client-side filtering using React state management. Use TypeScript for all components. Ensure all components are responsive and mobile-friendly. Follow a clean, minimalist design approach suitable for a B2B industrial company. Don't include any pricing or e-commerce functionality, as this is an informational B2B site.

Create reusable components for product cards, specification tables, and industry solution sections. Implement a consistent page structure across the site. Create a robust filtering system for products based on temperature ratings, cut resistance levels, and industry applications. Ensure all pages load quickly and meet Core Web Vitals performance standards.

Structure product data with fields for name, description, category, temperature_rating, cut_resistance_level, features, applications, industries, and images. Blog posts should have title, slug, content, author, and tags fields. Ensure all database queries are optimized and secure. Implement proper error handling for all API requests.
