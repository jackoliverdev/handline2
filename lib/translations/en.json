As non-exhaustive examples: cut, puncture, abrasion, tear, etc. resistance/protection reduce the risk of mechanical hazards but do not completely prevent or eliminate such risks, flame-resistant PPE lowers the risk of burns but does not prevent injury in all fire situations and are not 'fire-proof', cold-protective clothing mitigates frostbite but does not eliminate cold-related injury, chemical-resistant PPE reduce exposure risk but do not guarantee total protection against all substances, insulating gloves and mats reduce the risk of electrocution but cannot fully eliminate electrical hazards, radiation protective equipment mitigates certain radiation exposure risks but does not fully remove them. PPE should always be used as part of a comprehensive workplace safety system, which includes hazard control measures, training, supervision, and safe work procedures."
